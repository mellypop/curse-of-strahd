## History card: The Illusionist
> This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy……A man is not what he seems. He comes here in a carnival wagon. Therein lies what you seek.

This card may be a reference to [[../Characters/Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]] also known as Rictavio within [[../Locations/Barovia|Barovia]]. He was seen in [[../Locations/Vallaki/index|Vallaki]] putting on puppet shows for the local children. He was startled to see the party in [[../Locations/Vallaki/index|Vallaki]] and insisted on talking to them at the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]] in private so that he could maintain his cover.

He has information that may be useful about [[../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], but it is in an old language that he has not been able to fully translate yet. He asked the party to meet him at a tower he has somewhat settled in so that he can more fully discuss this.

## Powerful Force of Good and Protection/Holy symbol of great hope: The Myrmidon
> This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope…… Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking  a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to [[../Deities/Mother Night|Mother Night]].

## Power and Strength/Weapon of Vengeance/Sword of Light: The Avenger
> The treasure lies in a dragon’s house, in hands once clean and now corrupted.

- Run by Argan Vost. They resisted Strahd and were wiped out. Their keep still stands west of Vallaki. The keep is "definitely haunted"

## Shed light on one who will help/Ally: The Mists
> There is a Vistana who wanders this land alone searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place long, but you should be able to seek her out at St. Markovia's abbey, near the mists.

* West of Vallaki, you'll hit a fog wall. A town called [[../Locations/Krezk/index|Krezk]] has a church, and this is the abbey. Bring a gift, trade goods possibly? [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] offered to help with the gift if we spoke to him before we head to Krezk

## Where He Will Be: The Broken One
> Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.
