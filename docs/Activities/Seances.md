After initially getting set up in the house, [[../Characters/Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]] asked the group for help with a seance. He had found the [[../Items/Halvrest House/Spirit Board|Spirit Board]] in the house but needed the [[../Items/Halvrest House/Planchette|Planchette]]  and the party to actually perform a seance.

Seances are performed in the [[../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Parlor|Parlor]].

## Seances
1. During the first seance with Rudolph, the group spoke with a spirit claiming to be the spirit of [[../Characters/Halvrest House/Lady Mara Silvra|Lady Mara Silvra]] who told the group to "Evict [[../Characters/Halvrest House/The Chimney Witch|The Chimney Witch]]"
2. The second seance started much more quickly after the group sat down at the table. This seance was prompted by Rudolph noticing that the house seemed to "wake up". During this seance, the spirit told the group to "Evict [[../Characters/Halvrest House/The Leaper|The Leaper]]"
