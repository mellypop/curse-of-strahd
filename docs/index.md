## Open Questions
These questions are generally not related to a specific quest and are more likely still open story-hooks.

- Should we accept [[./Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s [[./Items/Vallaki/Dinner Invitation|Dinner Invitation]]?
	- Will he be mad if we don't?
- Is [[./Characters/Vallaki/Volenta|Volenta]] the reason [[./Characters/Vallaki/Felix|Felix]] is dead?
	- Did she have [[./Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]] steal the sacred bones of [[./Characters/Vallaki/St. Andril|St. Andril]]?

## Old Questions
These questions are old enough that answering them may require backtracking.

- Are [[./Characters/Vallaki/Muriel|Muriel]] and the [[./Characters/Halvrest House/Mysterious Figure|Mysterious Figure]] the same person?
- We have a [[./Items/Durst Residence/Deed to the Windmill|Deed to the Windmill]], and we know of a [[./Locations/Windmill|Windmill]]. Do we own said [[./Locations/Windmill|Windmill]]?
