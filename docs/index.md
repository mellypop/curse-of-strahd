## Open Questions
These questions are generally not related to a specific quest and are more likely still open story-hooks.

- Should we accept [Strahd](./Enemies/Strahd%20von%20Zarovich.md)'s [Dinner Invitation](./Items/Vallaki/Dinner%20Invitation.md)?
	- Will he be mad if we don't?
- Is [Volenta](./Characters/Vallaki/Volenta.md) the reason [Felix](./Characters/Vallaki/Felix.md) is dead?
	- Did she have [Milivolj](./Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj.md) steal the sacred bones of [St. Andril](./Characters/Vallaki/St.%20Andril.md)?

## Old Questions
These questions are old enough that answering them may require backtracking.

- Are [Muriel](./Characters/Vallaki/Muriel.md) and the [Mysterious Figure](./Characters/Halvrest%20House/Mysterious%20Figure.md) the same person?
- We have a [Deed to the Windmill](./Items/Durst%20Residence/Deed%20to%20the%20Windmill.md), and we know of a [Windmill](./Locations/Windmill.md). Do we own said [Windmill](./Locations/Windmill.md)?
