The former owner of [[../Locations/Rictavio's Tower|Rictavio's Tower]] who seems to have been a spellcaster of some kind. He is the one who devised the security system at the tower, which included a verbal activation (his name), a zone prohibiting magic, and a puzzle requiring both a source of heat and a source of cold.
