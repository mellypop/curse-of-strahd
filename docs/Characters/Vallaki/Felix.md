Felix is a child who lives at [[../../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]] and who was close friends with [[./Cedrick|Cedrick]]. The two children seemed to spend some time with [[./Milivolj|Milivolj]] occasionally, but the rest of the children at the [[../../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|orphanage]] (or at least those the party spoke to) seem to think of Felix as a strange child and possibly someone to be avoided.

The party spoke to what they thought might be Felix in the attic of the [[../../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|orphanage]], but this turned out to be a creature inhabiting his body. It seems as if Felix had been dead for at the very least several days, but it is unclear exactly when the real Felix was replaced.
