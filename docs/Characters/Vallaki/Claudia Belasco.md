A woman who works at [[St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]]. [[Faeryl Hune|Faeryl]] and [[Frost over the Grass|Frost]] were the first members of the party to meet her while looking into [[Recover Missing Church Property|missing church property]].

Claudia has been noticing strange things at the orphanage lately. An [[Cedrick|orphan]] has recently passed away, and when pressed, Claudia revealed that she had noticed "strange carvings" on the bedpost of the child. Happy to see two monster hunters, she handed over a [[Beyond the Morning Lord's Sight|book]] she found when trying to determine what the markings may have meant.
