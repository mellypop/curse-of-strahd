Frank was one of the guards at the [[../../../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]]. He came outside to investigate when [[../../../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] opened the front door while hiding herself behind the door. [[../../../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] hit him in the face with the pommel of her sword, and [[../../../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] failed to grapple him before he managed to call out to [[./Judd|Judd]] for help.

## Notes

- He had a hand-drawn sketch of [[./Judd|Judd]] in one of his pockets.
