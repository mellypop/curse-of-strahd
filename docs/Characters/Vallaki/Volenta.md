>[!quote] A very pale woman wearing a skeletal mask of some kind. She has black hair that falls in tight spirals.

This woman was hidden behind [[./Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] at first when the party entered [[../../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Church|St. Andril's Church]] after the [[../../Activities/Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]]. She started laughing, telling the [[./Father Lucian Petrovich|Father]] that he was wrong about how his parish originally served the [[../../Deities/Lathander|Morninglord]] but had since become lost and must find their way back.

From the look of things, she had been toying with the people in the [[../../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Church|church]], killing them but not before skewering their hands together in mock prayer using daggers she conjured out of thin air.

She asked the party why they wouldn't just stay and enjoy the party, and she even told [[../Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] that as long as she ran from [[../../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] things like this would continue to happen.
