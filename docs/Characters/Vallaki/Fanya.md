Fanya is the caretaker of [[St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]]. She seems to be somewhat bothered by [[Claudia Belasco|Claudia]] not always running decisions by her or even informing her of them. At least, this seemed to be the case when the party told her that they were investigating [[Cedrick|Cedrick]]'s death at her request. She also displayed deep distrust of the party when she was asked to get the children to safety so that the creature in the attic could be dealt with.

[[Thistle|Thistle]] spoke to Fanya first to seek information about [[Arabel|Arabel]], but she hadn't seen the child in a few days. She did say, though, that she heard the kids talking about her hanging around some man around the town. A tall, heavy-set man wearing a hat that the party later discovered to be [[Bludo|Bludo]].
