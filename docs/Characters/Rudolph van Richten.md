Rudolph (or "Rudy") is a monster hunter who seems to be somewhat on in his years. He showed up to [[../Locations/Halvrest House/index|Halvrest House]] with a cache of equipment and tasked the adventurers with looking for paranormal events around the house.

Occasionally he will ask the group to perform [[../Activities/Seances|Seances]] with him in order to contact the spirits of the house.

## Notes
- Rudolph was already at [[../Locations/Halvrest House/index|Halvrest House]] when the party arrived. He acts as if [[../Forces/The Mists|The Mists]] does not matter to him at all.
- Despite his weird presence at the house, Rudolph does not appear to also be a ghost, spirit, or other form of undead creature, according to [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]]'s detection spell.

## What?
------
The first night in [[../Locations/Vallaki/index|Vallaki]], the party hears carnival music played outside the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]]. When they went to investigate, [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] realizes that he was looking at Rudolph. Here, Rudolph is dressed in bright clothes and seems to be acting as an entertainer, mostly for children. He puts on a puppet show under the name Rictavio, and afterward, the party interrogates him. He acts as if he doesn't know them but looks to be somewhat afraid of speaking openly. 

At the followup conversation...

Every now and then, the mists open, and Rudolph was able to get into [[../Locations/Barovia|Barovia]]. He was mentioned in the [[../Activities/Fortune Reading|Fortune Reading]] as "The Illusionist". He is translating an old journal of [[./Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] and is mostly done. While he is translating, he asked the party to search out a wizard, supposedly [[./Morden Caden|Morden Caden]], who is living as a hermit north of Lake Zarchovia. The mad mage of Baratok
