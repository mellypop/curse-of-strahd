The Accountant is a ghostly figure inhabiting [[The Office|The Office]] on the second floor. He seems to not respond to anything that happens around him. 

## Encounters
1. [[Thorn|Thorn]] encountered the Accountant first after mysteriously vanishing during a long rest the first night. She tried multiple times to talk to him, and after a failed attempt to shake his incorporeal form, she gave up.
2. After rejoining the group after being separated, [[Thorn|Thorn]] led everyone into the Accountant's office. He once again did not respond to anything, even when [[Thorn|Thorn]] attempted to telepathically communicate with him.
