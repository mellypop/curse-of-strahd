Theodora is the wife of [[Loren Halvrest|Loren Halvrest]] and the mother of [[Regan Halvrest|Regan Halvrest]] and [[Vastion Halvrest|Vastion Halvrest]].

## Encounters
1. Theodora was seen in [[The Conservatory|The Conservatory]] in a mirror. The plants all seemed to be alive in this vision
2. Theodora's skeleton is sitting in a chair in the [[Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom|Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom]]. She is still wearing the [[Pendant|Pendant]].

## Notes
- The children talked about how their mother "prayed really hard" for their protection, and since the door to the [[Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom|Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom]] was emblazoned with the symbol of [[Ezra|Ezra]], Theodora may be a follower of Ezra.
