The Leaper was found at the top of [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Tower|Tower]]. They first pushed the group off of the narrow stairs but were then defeated by the group.

The Leaper screamed as they jumped or fell from the top of the tower. The scream would begin at the top of the tower and end at the bottom.

It is unclear why [[./Lady Mara Silvra|Lady Mara Silvra]] wanted the Leaper to be "evicted".
