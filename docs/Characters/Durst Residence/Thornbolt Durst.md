Thornbolt (Thorn) is the son of both [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]] and [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]]. He had two siblings [[Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]] and [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]].

The party first encountered Thornbolt in front of the [[Durst Residence|Durst Residence]], but they later discovered that while the entity looked and spoke like him, it was not him.

Thorn's spirit and remains were found in the childrens' bedroom in the [[Durst Residence|Durst Residence]] along with those of [[Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]]. The two of them had been locked away in this room so that they would be safe from the members of the [[Priests of Osybus|Priests of Osybus]] while they performed their rituals, but the last ritual was successful, which seems to have locked away the cultists, and therefore both Thornbolt and his sister either starved to death or otherwise died waiting on their parents to return for them.

To leave the room, Thornbolt's spirit needed to be carried by one of the party members, and at her husband's urging [[Thorn|Thorn]] carried his spirit with her until after the events at the house were concluded.
