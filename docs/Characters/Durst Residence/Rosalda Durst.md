Rosalda Durst is the daughter of both [[./Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]] and [[./Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]]. She was seemingly first encountered outside the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/Durst Residence|Durst Residence]] with her brother [[./Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]], asking the party to save their baby brother [[./Walter Durst|Walter Durst]].

After finding her spirit in the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom|Childrens' Bedroom]], the party was told that she and [[./Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]] were not the ones they encountered at first, which raises the question of who wanted the party to investigate their house.

After talking with the party, both she and [[./Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]] wanted to come along with the party so that their spirits may be put to rest, but in order to safely travel outside their safe room, they had to ride along in the body of one of the party members. Rose latched onto [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]]. Interestingly, while she was with him, [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] was able to cast a few cantrips (Light, Mending, and Shocking Grasp).
