Margaret seems to be the maid for the Durst family. Both [[Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]] and [[Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]] regard her fondly as if she has been good to them, and it may be possible that she is the actual mother of [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]] based on the contents of the [[Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst|Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst]], specifically the mention of having to go through "the harlot's...quarters" each time they go to one of their meetings, which must be accessed by going to the attic through Margaret's room and then to the basement via the hidden stairwell in the storage room.

## Notes
- When the party mentions [[Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]], she takes on a pleasant face, but the mention of [[Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]] elicits a more somber reaction.
- Margaret does not seem to be aware that Walter is not in the bundle she has been caring for
