Walter Durst is the youngest son of [[./Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]], but his mother appears to not have been [[./Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]], which accounts for her severe distaste for this child. It is very likely that Walter is the "unwanted fiend" referenced in the [[../../Items/Durst Residence/Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst|Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst]].

The party was first asked to save walter by who seemed to be [[./Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]] and [[./Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]] out in front of the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]], but a later encounter with these two revealed that this may not have been the case.

A white bundle of cloth bundle, assumed to hold Walter was found on the third floor of the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]]. The party was warned not to wake him by [[./Margaret|Margaret]], but upon getting to the attic, the party found the bundle to be empty.
