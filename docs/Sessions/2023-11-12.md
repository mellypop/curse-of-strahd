# Recap of Last Session

# Summary

The party has thus-far avoided a direct confrontation with the [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] by using the chaos of the vampires' attack to get away. [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went north with [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] while the rest of the party went to the [[Reformation Center|Reformation Center]].

>[!important] The party is unsure of where [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] is. She was last seen heading north with [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]].

At the [[Reformation Center|Reformation Center]], the# Summary

The party worked out a plan with the help of [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona Wachter]] before resting for the night. Early the next morning, they snuck into the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in the [[Town Square|Town Square]]. Everyone but [[Thistle|Thistle]] hid underneath the stage until [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] gave the signal (a large explosion in the distance). While there, the party noticed two coffin-shaped boxes in the center of the storage area, and [[Thorn|Thorn]] was able to tell that they each contained an undead creature.

>[!important] The party defeated [[Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]]

The party fought [[Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]], killing him and a few of the guards who were still loyal to [[Burgomaster Vargas|Burgomaster Vargas]], but once [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] was out of the way, a large portion of the guards turned on the [[Burgomaster Vargas|Burgomaster]], putting him in the stocks.

>[!danger] [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] woke up two [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] underneath the stage!

After this fight, [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went back underneath the stage to investigate the coffins, but in doing so, they accidentally awoke the [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]].
[[Lucia|Lucia]] who helped them defeat the guards inside and make their way into the basement find [[Irena|Irena]].

## Additional notes

>[!note] [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] also has our [[Bag of Holding|Bag of Holding]]
# Summary

After freeing [[Irena|Irena]] from her cell, the group left the [[Reformation Center|Reformation Center]] and headed to the north side of [[Vallaki|Vallaki]] to look for [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] and [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]]. After finding his house, they discovered a note saying that [[Frost over the Grass|Frost]] and [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili]] had taken some villagers to safety and that they would reconvene at a later date. They also found the [[Bag of Holding|Bag of Holding]] along with another, short note from [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili]].

> [!important] The [[Bag of Holding|Bag of Holding]] is now in [[Lucia|Lucia]]'s posession.

The group then went to pick up [[Lancelot|Lancelot]] from the [[Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]] and then went to [[St. Andril's Church|St. Andril's Church]] since it was on their way out of town where they met [[Volenta|Volenta]], one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] wives. She was torturing some townspeople in the [[St. Andril's Church|church]], and asked the group to stay for the "party." When they tried to leave, she told [[Irena|Irena]] that until she went to be with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] things like this would continue happening.

After the church incident, the party went to the [[Locations/Vallaki/Vistani Camp|Vistani Camp]] to rest for the day and night. [[Arugal|Arugal]] told them that they could stay but that he would not protect them from any of the vampires. He was also aware of what had been going on in [[Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Upon waking up, the group received a letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] inviting them to dinner at [[Castle Ravenloft|Castle Ravenloft]].

After deciding to delay their dinner with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], the group headed to [[Lake Baratok Tower|Lake Baratok Tower]]. The tower looked as if werewolves had run around near it but not near the cart that was parked outside. [[Thorn|Thorn]] tried the door, which electrocuted everyone.

> [!danger] The party was electrocuted by the magic protecting the tower!

[[Thorn|Thorn]] tried to read the faded writing at the door, eventually saying "Khazan" to which the door responded by revealing a puzzle. The group solved the puzzle, which granted them access to the tower.
# Long-form Notes

[[Irena|Irena]] seems shaken up after [[Thistle|Thistle]] freed her from her cell. As she comes out, she asks how many days it has been and wants to know what happened. This was explained by [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Thistle|Thistle]]. It has been roughly an hour since the fight with [[Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]] and the [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] were released.

[[Thorn|Thorn]] noticed that across the hall, there is a scratching noise coming from one of the cell doors in the basement. [[Thistle|Thistle]] opened this door, and a rat ran off into a burrow. Inside the cell was a dead person who may have been dead for perhaps a while. From the clothes, this person was dressed very commonly, so they may have been just some dude.

The group heads out of the basement, planning to go find [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]]. As they run, they see dozens of dead bodies that have been bitten and slashed by the [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]]. Inn a junction of roads, they see fewer and fewer bodies. [[Lucia|Lucia]] leads the group to a fancy manor on the norther side of town where she believes [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] lives. There is a gate around the manor, and the manor is two-stories. The building itself has a bright blue roof. There is a garden in front is nicer than most. There's a little gold trim of different aspects of the house. In short, the house screams [[Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili]].

[[Thorn|Thorn]] goes to knock on the door but discovers a note on the door. She grabs the note and unrolls it to see a hastily written note in fancy script that says "Dear companions, Frost and I have taken a survivor group into the foothills of Mount Baratok. Will reconvene at a later date. Love, Vasili". The note has a wax stamp on it.

[[Lucia|Lucia]] spotted a bundle of stuff near the gate to the manor. There is a bag with a note on it. She reads the note: "Dear companions, Frost said you'd need this. Didn't want someone random to see this from the road. Love, Vasili."  [[Thistle|Thistle]] places the large lockbox in the [[Bag of Holding|Bag of Holding]]. [[Lucia|Lucia]] is holding onto the bag for now.

[[Irena|Irena]] suggested to the group that the [[St. Andril's Church|St. Andril's Church]] might be in danger. They also need to go back to the [[Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]] to get [[Lancelot|Lancelot]].

The group gets back to the intersection where the [[Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]] is. [[Thistle|Thistle]] goes to enter first. As he enters the inn, he doesn't hear any particular noises or sights. There are no bodies inside, and if there are people here, they may be trying to stay quiet. After going up into the main bedroom, a secret hatch was found thanks to a bird who was [[Irwin|Irwin]], apparently. They got [[Lancelot|Lancelot]].

Next, they head to the west gate, hoping to eventually head to [[Argynvostholt|Argynvostholt]]. First, they stop by the [[St. Andril's Church|church]] to let them know. The church is full of imagery of the [[Lathander|Morninglord]]. Every candle in this church is lit. The group can see [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the pulpit. He seems to be giving an impassioned sermon at the moment. From what the group can see, the pews look full.

As [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Thistle|Thistle]] approach, they notice that there is blood on the carpet that seems to be coming from the pews. At first, they just see people with their hands together like they're praying. But as they get closer, they notice that every one of the people in the back row are all dead, and their hands are held in a praying motion by a dagger stuck through their hands.

[[Thorn|Thorn]] turns and tries to usher [[Thistle|Thistle]] back towards the entrance. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] talks about how they served the [[Lathander|Morninglord]] but are now lost. A woman behind him starts laughing and telling him that he is "so wrong about that." She stands up, notices the group, and asks why they are trying to leave. She's wearing a skeletal mask of some kind and is very pale. She has super spiraled curled black hair. She is being playfully sadistic. She puts her arm around [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] at which point he tenses up.

People in the front row seem to be moving. The woman is one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] brides and also a vampire. She talks about how vampires can't go in churches. She tells [[Irena|Irena]] that she should just go with her to where [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is. She says that this will keep happening as long as she doesn't just give in and go to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

The group exits the church and then [[Vallaki|Vallaki]], heading to the [[Locations/Vistani Camp/Vistani Camp|Vistani Camp]]. Everybody is now level 6!

After getting to the [[Locations/Vistani Camp/Vistani Camp|Vistani Camp]], the group talks to [[Arugal|Arugal]]. He was open to them staying but did mention that he wouldn't stop any of the vampires. He was, however, very aware of the goings on in [[Vallaki|Vallaki]].

The group received a letter overnight. [[Thorn|Thorn]] grabbed the letter from [[Arugal|Arugal]]. The seal of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] is on the letter. It says:

>My friends,
>
>My sincerest apologies on behalf of my bride, Volenta. I knew nothing of this plot of hers that seemed to grow out of hand. I wish to meet you in person to discuss the specifics of our situations. Know that it is I who have brought you to this land, my home, and know that I alone can release you from it. I bid you dine at my castle so that we can meet in civilized surroundings. Your passage here will be a safe one. I await your arrival.
>
>Your host,
>Strahd von Zarovich

When the group got within 20ft of the tower, [[Lucia|Lucia]]'s dragon disappears. [[Thistle|Thistle]] tried to cast a spell, but it didn't work.

The party then sets out of [[Lake Baratok Tower|Lake Baratok Tower]], telling [[Irena|Irena]] about what she missed. We eventually get to where we can see the tower. It's skinny and 4 stories tall. THere is a very ornate door. There is a big section of faded writing and a big, brass sigil on the door but no doorknob. There is a cart next to the tower. The first two floors of the tower are solid stone. On the third floor, it is still stone but wrapped in scaffolding that leads to a fourth floor.

[[Thorn|Thorn]] tries to recognize the sigil on the door. She knows it as the symbol for evocation magic.

The cart is definitely not [[Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s. It looks similar to a [[Vistani|Vistani]] cart with room for one bed. It's got some light. It's a wine-red colored tarp with worn wood on the sides.

[[Thistle|Thistle]] sees lots of werewolf tracks around the tower, but none of the tracks lead to the cart.

[[Thistle|Thistle]] goes to knock on the door. As he does so, the entire tower becomes electrified.

Above the door is written some faded words. [[Thorn|Thorn]] tries to read it and says "Khazan".

> [!note] The [[Lake Baratok Tower|Lake Baratok Tower]] was the person who lived in the tower previously.

When the sigil on the door flips over, it flips over to reveal two symbols. The top symbol is the symbol for heat, and the bottom symbol is the symbol for cold. [[Thorn|Thorn]] lit a torch, and [[Thistle|Thistle]] rips a piece of cloth off the bottom of his pants to tie around a crossbow bolt, which he lit on fire and then shot the bolt at the symbols. The heat symbol lit up but then turned off after a few seconds, confirming that the puzzle works the way they thought it did.

[[Lucia|Lucia]] had her dragon freeze the tip of an arrow and shot the cold symbol. And [[Thorn|Thorn]] touched a torch to the hot symbol.
