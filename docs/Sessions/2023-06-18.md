Searched [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]] after [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] cast Detect Evil and Good and got a locket that is empty but that seems to have been loosely close to whatever is cursing him.

[[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went outside the [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]] to check for disturbed ground. She saw two girls doing laundry. She didn’t notice any disturbed earth, but she went to check out the well, at which point the girls seemd interested in her. They seemed to think [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]] is strange and just digs holes and got sick from dirt. They heard he had been digging “on the other side of the property”. They warned Frost and Faeryl not to talk to Felix, who is “weird” and a friend of Cedric. Felix and Cedric lived in the same room.

[[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] walked through the [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|orphanage]] to try to sense the source of the evil. [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] asked after the caretaker [[../Characters/Vallaki/Fanya|Fanya]]. He also asked some children about [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]], and they hadn’t seen her in about a day. [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] noticed a creature’s presence when she got to the second floor.

[[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] spoke to [[../Characters/Vallaki/Fanya|Fanya]], asking about [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]]. She hadn’t seen her in a couple days. The last she heard, one of the kids saw her hanging around with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|some man]] around town. He was tall, heavy-set, and wearing a hat. He also asked about [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]]’s recent activity.

[[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] has noticed that every kid seems to have a bruise or scrape on their arm. One girl while reading kept scratching at her back every few moments. When asked, the girl mentioned a pain in her back that hurts but not in a way she would ascribe to sleeping poorly or something. The girl mentioned that she hadn’t seen [[../Characters/Vallaki/Felix|Felix]] in a few days.

[[../Characters/Vallaki/Fanya|Fanya]] is suspicious of the group, and she mentioned that all of the beds in the room except Felix’s have the same demonic writing on them. She knew she couldn’t stop them, but she did not cooperate to get the children out before the group went into the attic.

A young, brown haired boy of about 8 was in the attic carving symbols into wood. He is carving these symbols with a kitchen knife. This seems to be [[../Characters/Vallaki/Felix|Felix]].

After defeating the demon that was inside [[../Characters/Vallaki/Felix|Felix]], [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]] woke up. He got the necklace from [[../Characters/Vallaki/Henrick|Henrick]], the village coffin maker.

The party ran into [[../Characters/Vallaki/Claudia Belasco|Claudia]] on their way back to town. They explained the situation to her. When asked about [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]], she said that she may have seem her with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|some man]], a local fisherman, yesterday. He’s a “sad” guy, but him being with her did not seem insidious. His house is in town, and he typically fishes on [[../Locations/Lake Zarovich|Lake Zarovich]]. He lives on the northern side of town, close to the gate, in a dingy blue roofed house.

[[../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|some man]]’s neighbor said that he left to fish with a [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|little girl]]. He also was talking about a “good luck charm”. When the party gets to the lake, it looks like it might rain.

[[../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|some man]] tossed [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]] overboard, and a [[../Enemies/Lake Zarovich/Skeletal Shark|skeletal shark]] attacked. [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] swam down and cut her free of the sack she was in, and [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] killed [[../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|some man]]. 

[[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl]] casted an illusion that kept the shark busy while the party fought it.

After the fight, [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] rowed the boat back to shore, and [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl]] performed CPR.

Thorn has advantage on her next roll for a joke or something
