After their meeting with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] at the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]], the party decides to split up to go back to [[../Locations/Vallaki/Blinski's Toys|Blinski's Toys]] ([[../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] and [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]]), to [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]] ([[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]]) to ask about the stolen property, and to the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Vistani Camp|Vallaki Vistani encampment]] near ([[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] and [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]]) to deliever [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]]'s toys.

In the middle of the night, a knock wakes Irena, Thistle, and Thorn. [[../Characters/Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]] was at the door and wanted to have the conversation they couldn't have before.

At [[../Locations/Vallaki/Blinski's Toys|Blinsky's Toys]], [[../Characters/Vallaki/Blinski|Blinski]] noticed that  [[../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] looks like the dolls that he has been making for [[../Characters/Vallaki/Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]]. Unfortunately, his latest creation seems to have already been picked up. He has been making them for years, but Irena told him that if he makes another one in her image, she will break his hands.

At the [[../Locations/Vistani Camp/Vistani Camp|Vallaki Vistani Camp]], [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] and [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] meet with discover that [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]] has gone missing (see: [[../Quests/Arabel Missing|Arabel Missing]]). 

At [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Church|St. Andril's Church]], [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] got more information about the [[../Quests/Recover Missing Church Property|Recover Missing Church Property]] quest. She then headed to the orphanage, where she ran into [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]].

Weird things have been happening at [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|St. Andril's Orphanage]]. An orphan has died from falling out a window, and several of the children have recently started having bad dreams. The person working at the orphanage, [[../Characters/Vallaki/Claudia Belasco|Claudia Belasco]], found "strange carvings" on the bedpost of the recently deceased orphan. She was happy to see two  monster hunters and handed Faeryl a book entitled [[../Items/Vallaki/Beyond the Morning Lord's Sight|Beyond the Morning Lord's Sight]], which turned out to be a book of fake information about demons and lore.

[[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] and [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] make it to the orphanage as [[../Characters/Vallaki/Claudia Belasco|Claudia Belasco]] is leaving. At this time, [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] and [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]], have made it to [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]]'s room.
