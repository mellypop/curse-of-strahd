# Summary

The party has thus-far avoided a direct confrontation with the [[../Enemies/Vallaki/Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] by using the chaos of the vampires' attack to get away. [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went north with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] while the rest of the party went to the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]].

>[!important] The party is unsure of where [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] is. She was last seen heading north with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]].

At the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]], the rest of the group met [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] who helped them defeat the guards inside and make their way into the basement find [[../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]].
# Long-form Notes

[[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] and [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] ran out from underneath the stage to get away from the vampire spawn. After rejoining the group, Thorn heard [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] calling out to the party, and she ran off toward him while [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] ran off toward the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]]. [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] followed [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]], and [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] ran through the square trying to tell villagers to run home.

[[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] caught up with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] who was dressed a bit more formally, presumably. He says that he will meet up with [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] to help the villagers.

>[!info] The party is unsure of where [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] is. She was last seen heading north with [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]].

[[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] got to the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Burgomaster's Mansion|Burgomaster's Mansion]] first and ran into [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] when trying to get to the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]]. Without much time to discuss, the two of them proceeded to try to rescue [[../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] from the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]]. Upon seeing the door being opened, one of the guards, [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Frank|Frank]], came to investigate and was immediately struck in the face by [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]]. [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Frank|Frank]] called out to [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Judd|Judd]] for help, and the two of them fought with [[../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl]] and [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] until [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] and [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] showed up to help. The battle was over soon after. Judd and Frank did not have any keys on them, but they had a combined 25c. They each had a drawing of the other in their pockets.

>[!danger] [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] was struck by a sigil of warning

After the battle, the party entered the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]] and found the courtroom. [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] proceeded to try to enter a room marked as the "Reformer's Dorm", but she was instead struck by a magic sigil that sent her flying. After [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] healed her and helped her back up, she told the group that it was unlikely that another sigil was in place. She did cast Detect Magic to be sure, though. She noticed that several sources of magic existed in the room, so she and the party investigated. 50g 10s 25c and a [[../Items/Vallaki/Cloak of Elvenkind|Cloak of Elvenkind]] was found in a chest in the reformer's dorm. Behind a false back in the wardrobe was a small metal box that is locked. Something inside it seems to be magical. It should be opened later.

>[!note] Loot!
>50 gold, 10 silver, and 25 copper
>1 [[../Items/Vallaki/Cloak of Elvenkind|Cloak of Elvenkind]]
>1 [[../Items/Vallaki/Small Locked Chest|Small Locked Chest]]


There are 3 separate barracks on the first floor of the [[../Locations/Vallaki/Reformation Center|Reformation Center]], but none of the foot lockers in them hold anything but a backup uniform. It looks like quite a few guards are normally stationed here but that they may be elsewhere because of the [[../Activities/Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]].

There is one door on the first floor protected by what looks to be another sigil of warding. This door has a keyhole, so hopefully using its key to unlock the door will nullify the sigil.

> [!danger] There is another sigil of warding on a door on the first floor

On the second floor, the group found a room with several holding cells. They could hear the shuffling and voices of more than one guard, and one of them immediately shouted towards the door asking who was there. [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] pretended to be [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Frank|Frank]] looking for [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Judd|Judd]], which bought the party a little time to think. Then, [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] pretended to be [[../Characters/Vallaki/Guards/Frank|Frank]] once more and called the guards out, telling them that they'll "never believe this".

The party then fought the three guards who conscripted three of the prisoners into the fight. [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] turned one of their corpses into a zombie to help in the fight.

>[!note] One of the guards had a key around his neck

The key opened the locked door on the first floor, dispelling the sigil of warding harmlessly. As the party followed the stairs behind the door down into the basement, they all became unable to hear anything at all or speak. A glowing blue orb in the center of the first room in the basement was the only real source of light, but [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] noticed that it might be the source of the strange, silencing phenomenon. She destroyed it, and the group was once again able to hear and speak.

Once the silence had been lifted, someone could be heard knocking at one of the doors that looked like they led to individual sensory deprivation cells. [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] approached the door and asked if the person inside was [[../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]]. She answered and was able to answer his question to verify her identity, so [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] opened the door, letting her out.
