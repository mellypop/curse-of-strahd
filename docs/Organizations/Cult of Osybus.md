This cult was a gathering of worshipers of [[../Deities/Osybus|Osybus]] whose main goal seemed to be to achieve immortality. Their rituals took place in the basement underneath the  [[../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]], and while their final ritual may have "worked," the result was making them undead.
