The Plaguebringer is an enemy that the party fought in the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Master Bedroom|Master Bedroom]]. This is one of the enemies that was not specifically mentioned as a target for the party, but it is unclear whether or not it would have been.

After its defeat, the Plaguebringer dissolved onto the bed in the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Master Bedroom|Master Bedroom]], leaving a residue behind.

## Notes
- Since this monster was found in the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Master Bedroom|Master Bedroom]], which smelled of the chemical medicines that [[../../Characters/Halvrest House/Loren Halvrest|Loren Halvrest]] possibly took to deal with the illness that eventually killed him, could the Plaguebringer be Loren or what caused his illness?
- The children told the party that the [[../../Characters/Halvrest House/The Hungry Things|The Hungry Things]] killed their father. Is the Plagubringer related to them?
