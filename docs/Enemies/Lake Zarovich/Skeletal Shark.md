This enemy appeared on [[../../Locations/Lake Zarovich|Lake Zarovich]] after [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Bludo|Bludo]] tossed [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]] out of his boat. The party disturbed the shark's potential meal, which led to a struggle on the [[../../Locations/Lake Zarovich|lake]]. This shark was accompanied by two [[./Goblin Shark|Goblin Shark]]s but was quickly distracted by [[../../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]]'s illusion of a large mass of "meaty babies".
