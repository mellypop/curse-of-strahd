While setting up to prepare for their plan for the [[../../Activities/Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in [[../../Locations/Vallaki/index|Vallaki]], [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] and [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] discovered two coffins underneath the stage. These seemed ominous since they were purposefully located centrally underneath the stage away from the rest of the boxes of equipment and [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] could tell that they contained one undead creature each.

After defeating [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]], [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] and [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went back underneath the stage, hoping to figure out what was going on and stop what could be a massacre. Unfortunately, while investigating [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] moved one of the lids ever so slightly, which prompted one of the two [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] to climb out, followed by the other.
