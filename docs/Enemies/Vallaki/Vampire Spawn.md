While setting up to prepare for their plan for the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] in [[Vallaki|Vallaki]], [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] discovered two coffins underneath the stage. These seemed ominous since they were purposefully located centrally underneath the stage away from the rest of the boxes of equipment and [[Thorn|Thorn]] could tell that they contained one undead creature each.

After defeating [[Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]], [[Thorn|Thorn]] and [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went back underneath the stage, hoping to figure out what was going on and stop what could be a massacre. Unfortunately, while investigating [[Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] moved one of the lids ever so slightly, which prompted one of the two [[Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] to climb out, followed by the other.
