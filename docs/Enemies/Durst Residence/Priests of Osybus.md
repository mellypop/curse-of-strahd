This is a necromantic cult to [[../../Deities/Osybus|Osybus]].

The ritual for this cult was performed no less than 35 times in an attempt to render the members of this cult immortal. While the last ritual seems to have been successful, their "immortality" really turned them into ghasts who are now either trapped beneath the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]] or who may be dead.

It is unclear how many members of the cult existed, but a few have been named based on documents found in the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]]:
