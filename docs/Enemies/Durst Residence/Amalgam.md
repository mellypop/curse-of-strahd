This creature is an amalgamation of seemingly all of the previous victims of the ritual sacrifices associated with the [[./Priests of Osybus|Priests of Osybus]].

It looks as if this creature was the final result of a successful ritual. According to the [[../../Items/Durst Residence/Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst|Mysterious Letter from Mrs. Durst]], the sacrifice for this ritual may have been [[../../Characters/Durst Residence/Walter Durst|Walter Durst]], and if that is the case, his skeleton formed the core of this creature and had to be destroyed in order for the creature to be defeated.

## Notes
- This creature pulled [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] into itself in an attempt to devour her, and this is how she was able to destroy the core skeleton
