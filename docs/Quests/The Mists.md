>[!important] Bring a gift! [[../Characters/Vallaki/Vasili von Holdzt|Vasili von Holdzt]] offered to help with this if we let him know before we head to [[../Locations/Krezk/index|Krezk]].

West of [[../Locations/Vallaki/index|Vallaki]] is a town called [[../Locations/Krezk/index|Krezk]], which has a church named [[../Locations/Krezk/St. Markovia's Abbey|St. Markovia's Abbey]], which the fortune directly speaks of. This town is secluded and not very welcoming of visitors, so bringing a gift of some sort (e.g., trade goods).
