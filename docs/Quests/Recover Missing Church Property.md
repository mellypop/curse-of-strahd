> Something has come up missing from the church, something pretty important, in the last few days, so if you would like to use the [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|orphanage]], I will need your help with this.

The bones of an old saint were what sanctified the grounds of the church at [[../Locations/Vallaki/St. Andril's Orphanage|orphanage]]. They went missing somewhere around 4 days before [[../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] went back to talk to [[../Characters/Vallaki/Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]].

[[../Characters/Vallaki/Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]] seems to suspect the orphanage's handyman named [[../Characters/Vallaki/Milivolj|Milivolj]] who grew up in the orphanage and now works for it.
