[[The Mists|The Mists]] is what led the group of adventurers to [[../Locations/Halvrest House/index|Halvrest House]]. It seems to fully surround the house, and at first, the group refused to enter the Mists at all.

## Notes
- [[../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] attempted to run away from [[../Locations/Halvrest House/index|Halvrest House]] through [[The Mists|The Mists]] only to find herself running back toward the house seemingly without turning around.
- [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] tossed a rock into [[The Mists|The Mists]], which then flew right back out and struck [[../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]].
