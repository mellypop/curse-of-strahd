[[../../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] noticed this book in the [[../../Locations/Durst Residence/index|Durst Residence]]. At first, it contained a biography for Faeryl, leading up to her supposed death by a creature standing behind her. The last page featured what looked like a blood stain to her but an ink stain to [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]].

[[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] did not see the title on the spine of this book like [[../../Party/Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] did, and upon opening it again, the words and ink stain seemed to be entirely gone.
