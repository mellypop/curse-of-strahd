> Your advice on dealing with the unwanted fiend in my home is quite good advice indeed. Tonight's ceremony will proceed as planned when the moon is at its highest peak - without, of course, the attendance of [[../../Characters/Durst Residence/Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]]. I must agree with you that, with the assistance of such a remarkably innocent subject, the results of our proceedings may be far improved. "Innocent," of course, is not quite the term I would use.

> If nothing else, I am relieved that I shall soon no longer have to suffer the harlot's insufferable presence each time we must pass through her quarters to our meeting-space. We shall be well rid of her indeed.

> My Thanks,
