>My friends,

>My sincerest apologies on behalf of my bride, Volenta. I knew nothing of this plot of hers that seemed to grow out of hand. I wish to meet you in person to discuss the specifics of our situations. Know that it is I who have brought you to this land, my home, and know that I alone can release you from it. I bid you dine at my castle so that we can meet in civilized surroundings. Your passage here will be a safe one. I await your arrival.

>Your host,
>Strahd von Zarovich
