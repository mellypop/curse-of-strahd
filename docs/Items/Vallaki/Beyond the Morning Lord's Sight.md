This book was purchased by [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Claudia Belasco|Claudia Belasco]] because she seemed to think that the carvings in the bedpost of the recently deceased orphan, [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Cedrick|Cedrick]]'s, bedpost looked like the writing in the book.

Most of the book is written in Infernal. It contains the equivalent of fairy tales.
