This sword was found in the inky water that was at the bottom of the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Pit|Pit]].

## Notes
- [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]] kept this sword
- According to [[../../Characters/Daggerford/Helmick|Helmick]], this sword is "very cursed" and will make the wielder mad (read crazy) if someone hurts them. "It is a good sword, though"
