This axe was seen by [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] as she ran back to the house after attempting to escape.

The axe has frogs that seem to be spewing a large amount of liquid embossed on it.

After going back into the house [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] asked [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] to chop her leg off since it had been injured by the earworms and seemed to be burning. When [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] refused to chop the leg off, [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] requested the axe, which was given to her at which point she cut off her own leg and attacked the party.

After the group successfully saved [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] from her possession, the axe sank into a pool of [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]]'s blood along with her severed leg.
