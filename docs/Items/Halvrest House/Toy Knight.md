The Toy Knight was found in the [[../../Locations/Halvrest House/Rooms/Childrens' Bedroom|Childrens' Bedroom]] currently houses [[../../Characters/Halvrest House/Regan Halvrest|Regan Halvrest]]'s spirit. She noted that she had a sword but that she could not draw it.

It seems like the knight is unable to move on its own.

After cleansing the house, the spirit of [[../../Characters/Halvrest House/Regan Halvrest|Regan Halvrest]] left this toy.
