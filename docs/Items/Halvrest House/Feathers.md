Five [[../../Motifs and Symbols/Raven|Raven]] feathers were found along with the [[./Planchette|Planchette]]. [[../../Party/Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]], [[../../Characters/Daggerford/Leopold Grummél|Leopold Grummél]], [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]], [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]], and [[../../Party/Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] each kept one of the feathers.

## Notes
- [[../../Characters/Daggerford/Leopold Grummél|Leopold Grummél]] uses one of these feathers as a magically enhanced light source.
- [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] cast light on [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]]'s feather to give him some light.
