## Backstory

Thorn lost her mother at an early age and had very few interactions with her father, most of those very hostile. She has spent the majority of her life trying to make something of herself, but managing to get much of anywhere without coin is next to impossible.

For a while, she thought she could simply rise above this system, but after years of disappointments, she turned to scamming nobles out of their, at least in her mind, illegitimately gained wealth. These scams often took the form of passing off hastily thrown together mixtures and elixirs for "skin care". An unfortunate batch very quickly caused boils and hives on most anyone who used it, and her previously unwitting customers turned on her, sending guards and sometimes mercenaries after her for a refund in the form of her life.

After running from one such group of mercenaries, Thorn happened upon a worshipper of [[../Deities/Loviatar|Loviatar]] who was highly amused at the suffering Thorn's mixtures caused the noble women. This woman, who introduced herself as [[../Characters/Flail Lytheborne|Flail Lytheborne]], took Thorn in, teaching her how to read people to find the most effective way to get their coin and how to make them feel like the loss was their fault.

After spending a few years with [[../Characters/Flail Lytheborne|Flail]], Thorn began to grow interested in the power given to clerics of [[../Deities/Loviatar|Loviatar]] and began a journey of learning to inflict suffering. This didn't bring her any particular joy, but the associated power was enticing and helped her more easily manipulate her marks.

*slipped and managed to slam her head so hard into a large rock that her pursuers assumed her dead. This would have been lucky for her if the head injury did not also rob her of her memories.*

### Post-Accident
Thorn does not remember much before she washed up near Dawngleam and met [[./Thistle|Thistle]]. In fact, Thorn picked her name shortly after meeting Thistle because she couldn't remember what hers used to be. A few years have passed since that day, and the two have since gotten married.

One thing that Thorn did remember was her religion. While she isn't entirely sure why or when she started praying to [[../Deities/Loviatar|Loviatar]], but she does have a feeling that the deity is important to her because of a deep-felt need to both look after herself and punish those who hurt anyone or anything she cares about.

## Motivations
- Thorn wants to recover her memories of her past, but this feels like more of a secondary or tertiary motivator to her.

## Notes
- Thorn met [[./Frost over the Grass|Frost over the Grass]], [[../Characters/Daggerford/Leopold Grummél|Leopold Grummél]], and [[./Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] on her way to [[../Locations/Halvrest House/index|Halvrest House]].
- Thorn attempted to kill [[./Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] after she attacked [[./Thistle|Thistle]] with the [[../Items/Halvrest House/Berserker Axe|Berserker Axe]]. [[./Former Members/Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] seems to have been possessed, having also cut her own leg off after evil earworms left burn marks on it.
