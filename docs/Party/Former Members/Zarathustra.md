Zarathustra is a pacifist druid, often staying out of combat. She is strong-willed, even refusing to scream in pain after losing her leg.

After the second seance, Zarathustra became agitated and rushed out of the house and into [[../../Forces/The Mists|The Mists]], which sent her running back toward the house. After a slower attempt, she realized that going through was not possible. She was then struck by a rock that [[../Thorn|Thorn]] threw into [[../../Forces/The Mists|The Mists]]

After this, she saw a glint under the porch of the house. She ran to the spot it was located and started bashing the porch, which started a fight with the [[../../Enemies/Halvrest House/Earwigs|Earwigs]]. After the fight, it was discovered that the gling was a [[../../Items/Halvrest House/Berserker Axe|Berserker Axe]].

The party went back inside, but Zarathustra's leg had been injured in the fight. She said that it was burning and asked [[../Thistle|Thistle]] to amputate it for her. When he refused, she asked for the axe and then cut her own leg off. In an attempt to stop the bleeding, [[../Thistle|Thistle]] attempted to cauterize the wound, but Zarathustra attacked him.

At this point, the party knocked her out, gave her a Greater Healing Potion, and left her with [[../../Characters/Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]] to watch over her. Afterward, her leg melted into the puddle of her blood.

## Notes
- After the events of House of Lament, Zarathustra decided to part ways with the party.
