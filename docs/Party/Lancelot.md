Lancelot the dog was found in the [[../Locations/Durst Residence/Durst Residence|Durst Residence]]. Upon finding him, [[./Thistle|Thistle]] asked [[./Thorn|Thorn]] if the two of them could adopt the dog if his current owners were not found. It is unclear who those owners are, and since they do not seem to be nearby, it looks like Lancelot may join the party going forward.
