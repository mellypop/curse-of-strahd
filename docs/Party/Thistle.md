Thistle is a Changeling werewolf who is married to [[Thorn|Thorn]]. He is a good-spirited, charitable person who looks to find good and humor in all situations. Some of his mannerisms may come off as a bit goofy, but he is always trying to find a positive resolution.

## Notes
- [[Leopold Grummél|Leopold Grummél]] augmented Thistle's Battle Axe so that it would return to him when it is thrown.
- [[Zarathustra|Zarathustra]] attacked Thistle after he attempted to cauterize her heavily bleeding wound from when she amputated her own leg.
