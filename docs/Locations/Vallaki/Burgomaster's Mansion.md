Located in [[./Vallaki|Vallaki]], This building is longer than it is wide. It looks to have several routes in and out.

When inside, the party encounters a room of women who seem to just be chatting. These all seem to be noble women, and there is one who seems to stand out and be the focal point of the conversation who is also at the head of the table.
