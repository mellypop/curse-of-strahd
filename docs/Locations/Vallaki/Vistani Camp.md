Horse carts are clustered around a tent near the top of a hill in the woods. This is of a similar size to the [[Locations/Vistani Camp/Vistani Camp|Vistani Camp (Village of Barovia)]] but seemingly more permanent. [[Arugal|Arugal]] is the leader of this camp, and he lives in the largest tent with his brother [[Lou Vaash|Lou Vaash]] and daughter [[Arabel|Arabel]].

## Notes

- Members of this camp are not allowed inside [[Vallaki|Vallaki]], presumably because of the known [[Vistani|Vistani]] dealings with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]].
