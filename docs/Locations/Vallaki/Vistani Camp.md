Horse carts are clustered around a tent near the top of a hill in the woods. This is of a similar size to the [[../Vistani Camp/Vistani Camp|Vistani Camp (Village of Barovia)]] but seemingly more permanent. [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arugal|Arugal]] is the leader of this camp, and he lives in the largest tent with his brother [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Lou Vaash|Lou Vaash]] and daughter [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Vistani Camp/Arabel|Arabel]].

## Notes

- Members of this camp are not allowed inside [[./Vallaki|Vallaki]], presumably because of the known [[../../Organizations/Vistani|Vistani]] dealings with [[../../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]].
