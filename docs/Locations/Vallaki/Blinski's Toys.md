[[../../Characters/Vallaki/Blinski|Blinski]] runs a toy store in [[./Vallaki|Vallaki]] and does not allow [[../../Organizations/Vistani|Vistani]] customers to enter. The shop is located near the town square. The sign in front of the shop has a large B on it, and two arched windows have various decorations. On says "Is no fun; is no Blinski"

Inside the store, there are several odd choices of toy: a doll with interchangable sack heads (each with a sewn shut mouth), a merry-go-round with children being chased by wolves, a set of ventrilloquist's dummies made to look like [[../../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], a doll that looks like [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] ( commissioned by [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Izek Strazni|Izek Strazni]], one of the Baron's number one henchman)
