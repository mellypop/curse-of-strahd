This church, currently under the care of [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian Petrovich]], is a church for the [[../../Deities/Lathander|Morninglord]]. The grounds here are sanctified thanks to the bones of a saint, [[../../Characters/Vallaki/St. Andril|St. Andril]], but these remains have been removed recently, causing the previously sanctified land to no longer be protected.

## Vampire Attack

On their way out of [[./index|Vallaki]], the party stoped by here, at the behest of [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] and [[../../Party/Lucia|Lucia]]. Despite the recent [[../../Enemies/Vallaki/Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] attack, every candle inside the church was lit. Since the citizens of [[./index|Vallaki]] were mostly unaware of the fact that the church grounds were no longer sanctified, many of them had gathered here, probably to seek shelter from the attack.

Upon entering the church, the group saw [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] giving what appeared to be an impassioned sermon to a packed house. [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] and [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] approached slowly, trying to figure out what was going on, only to realize that the carpet was drenched in blood, seemingly coming from the pews. The people in the back row all appeared to be dead with their hands held together in mock prayer by daggers.

As [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] attempted to usher [[../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] quietly back toward the door, [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] preached frantically about how the people of [[./index|Vallaki]] had previously faithfully served the [[../../Deities/Lathander|Morninglord]] but are now lost, at which point a [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Volenta|woman]], started laughing and stood up. She looked over toward the party and asked why they were trying to leave.

This woman was [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Volenta|woman]], one of [[../../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]]'s wives, and she admitted to having [[../../Characters/Vallaki/St. Andril|St. Andril]]'s bones stolen from the church so that she and the [[../../Enemies/Vallaki/Vampire Spawn|Vampire Spawn]] could put together this little "party." She again invited the party to stay, and when they continued leaving, she told [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] that as long as she defied [[../../Enemies/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] wishes for her to join him, things like this will continue to happen.
