Supposedly a few days travel from the [[../Village of Barovia/index|Village of Barovia]], this town is said to be more fortified, and it is the place that [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Ismark|Ismark]] wants the party to take his sister [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]].

The [[../../Characters/Vallaki/Burgomaster Vargas|Burgomaster Vargas]] seems to owe [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Ismark|Ismark]] and [[../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]]'s family a favor.

-------
This town is surrounded by a 10ft. wall and stands in front of the massive [[../Lake Zarovich|Lake Zarovich]]. The gates to the town are large, well fortified, and have 6 pikes in front of them. On each of these pikes is the head of a wolf. Two well-outfitted guards armed with crossbows stand atop the wall.

A discarded flyer is found: 

>Wolfhead Jamboree
>
> Death to the minions of Strahd. All will be well


Of note, lots of wicker is seen around town, seemingly to be used for the upcoming [[../../Activities/Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]].
