The tower seemingly has only one entrance, a door on the [[./First Floor|First Floor]]. Inside the tower is a spiral staircase built into the wall that has a banister that goes only partway up.

## Characters
[[../../Characters/Halvrest House/The Leaper|The Leaper]] attacked the group, pushing them off the stairs as they got to the top of the tower.

## Secrets
At the top of the tower, a [[../../Motifs and Symbols/Raven|Raven]] symbol was etched into the wall. [[../../Characters/Daggerford/Leopold Grummél|Leopold Grummél]] began to push on the wall, which released a set of [[../../Items/Halvrest House/Ringmail Armor|Ringmail Armor]], seemingly having been well-used and repaired several times.
