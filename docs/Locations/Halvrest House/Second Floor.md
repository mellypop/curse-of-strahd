The second floor of [[./index|Halvrest House]] is the second/third floor that the party visited. [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] woke up here after going missing the first night and found the body of a [[../../Motifs and Symbols/Raven|Raven]].

While exploring the second floor on her own, [[../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] went to open a door and had a [[../../Motifs and Symbols/Raven|Raven]] fall on her. She also performed a spell on this floor to detect evil and was surprised to find that the whole house seems to have been somehow magically desecrated.
