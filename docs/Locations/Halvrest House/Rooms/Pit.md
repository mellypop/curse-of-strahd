An Amber Monolith is emitting an amber light at the bottom of this pit.

## Things that happened
- After the monolith was shattered, the inky water around it drained away. Several [[../../../Items/Halvrest House/Pendant|Pendant]]s, along with a [[../../../Items/Halvrest House/Sword of Vengeance|Sword of Vengeance]] became visible.  

## Notes
- [[../../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] cast light on a rock that [[../../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] dropped into the Pit. Afterward, only [[../../../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] heard the sound of the rock hitting water.
