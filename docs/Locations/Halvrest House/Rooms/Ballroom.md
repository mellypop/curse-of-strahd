This room was on the [[../First Floor|First Floor]].

There is a closet in this room with decorations from past events, among them is a banner that reads "Happy Birthday Regan and Vastion".

After the encounter with [[../../../Characters/Halvrest House/Dalk Dranzorg|Dalk Dranzorg]], the stained glass cracked even more than it had originally been.

## Encounters
- The spirit of [[../../../Characters/Halvrest House/Dalk Dranzorg|Dalk Dranzorg]] appeared in this room the first time the party entered. He gave them a choice to "betray your commander or join her in the walls".
