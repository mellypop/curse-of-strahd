Supposedly a few days travel from the [[Village of Barovia|Village of Barovia]], this town is said to be more fortified, and it is the place that [[Ismark|Ismark]] wants the party to take his sister [[Irena|Irena]].

The [[Burgomaster Vargas|Burgomaster Vargas]] seems to owe [[Ismark|Ismark]] and [[Irena|Irena]]'s family a favor.

-------
This town is surrounded by a 10ft. wall and stands in front of the massive [[Lake Zarovich|Lake Zarovich]]. The gates to the town are large, well fortified, and have 6 pikes in front of them. On each of these pikes is the head of a wolf. Two well-outfitted guards armed with crossbows stand atop the wall.

A discarded flyer is found: 

>Wolfhead Jamboree
>
> Death to the minions of Strahd. All will be well


Of note, lots of wicker is seen around town, seemingly to be used for the upcoming [[Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]].
