This building in the [[../index|Village of Barovia]] stands inside a very weathered wall made of iron and stone. The first story of the house's windows all seem to have been broken inwards. 

Upon approaching this building the first time, the party hears something slam against a wall, most likely having been thrown during an argument. Once they got there, they found [[../../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Ismark|Ismark]] and his sister [[../../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] there.

## Events
- [[ Ismark| Ismark]] and [[../../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] fought on the first time the party entered the house. [[../../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Irena|Irena]] was angry about [[../../../Characters/Village of Barovia/Ismark|Ismark]] attempting to get her to leave before they have buried their father.
