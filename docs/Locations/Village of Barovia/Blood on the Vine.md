The sign out front of this tavern looks as if it used to say "Blood of the Vine". The bartender here seems to dissociate while cleaning the same piece of glassware and is not very responsive to conversation.

## Encounters
- A [[Raven|Raven]] seemed to lead the party to this tavern, and when [[Thorn|Thorn]] tried to speak to it using telepathy, it responded (in Common), and told her to go inside.
- While the party sat at a table in this tavern, a man named [[Ismark|Ismark]] sat down to join them.
	- During this encounter, he mentioned three women in the tavern who can "travel more freely" than most others [[Alenca|Alenca]], [[Mirabel|Mirabel]], and [[Sorvia|Sorvia]]
