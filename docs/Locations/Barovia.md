It is said that traveling in Barovia at night is dangerous, especially on foot. Wolves and other strange creatures roam this land.

For the most part, Barovia is a land cut off from the rest of the world by [[../Forces/The Mists|The Mists]]. Every so often, unwitting people enter, but none (besides the [[../Organizations/Vistani|Vistani]]) seem to be able to leave. Inter-town travel seems to be a rarity as well, most likely due to the inherent danger in travelling these lands.

But one mysterious person seems known to all who inhabit Barovia: [[../Characters/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]].
