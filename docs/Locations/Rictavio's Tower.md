>[!description] This tower stands on a small peninsula of [[Lake Baratok|Lake Baratok]]. It's a skinny, stone tower that stands 4 stories tall with wooden scaffolding wrapping around the uppermost floor. Faded writing and a big brass sigil decorate the front door that happens to have no handle.

This tower is currently serving as [[../Characters/Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio's]] base of operation, though its former owner seems to have been [[../Characters/Khazan|Khazan]], based on the security measures that protect it.

## Discovery

Upon arriving at the tower, the party noticed that the front door had no doorknob, and [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] recognized the sigil on the door as being the symbol for evocation magic. She was unable to detect the presence of magic because the area around the tower somehow nullifies magic.

[[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] noticed that a lot of werewolf tracks were present around the tower but none seemed to lead to a cart that was parked nearby. He went to knock on the door, but as he knocked, the entire tower became electrified, hurting him and launching him backward.

### Door Puzzle

Upon further investigation, [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] realized that the faded words above the door read "[[../Characters/Khazan|Khazan]]," and as she spoke that name aloud, the brass sigil on the door flipped over to reveal two more symbols, one the symbol for heat and the other the symbol for cold.

The party guessed correctly that the puzzle required something cold and something hot to touch the respective symbol, but because magic wasn't an option near the tower, [[../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] shot a flaming arrow at the symbol for heat, which lit up in response. Since this was a difficult shot, though, the group resorted to having [[../Party/Lucia|Lucia]] shoot an arrow frozen by her dragon at the cold symbol while [[../Party/Thorn|Thorn]] held a lit torch to the hot symbol, which caused the sigil to flip once more, revealing a handle for the door.
