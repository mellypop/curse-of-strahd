# Durst Residence
The party entered this house, seemingly at the behest of [[Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]] and [[Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]] in order to save their baby brother [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]]. They were told that he could be found on the third floor, so the party's first goal was to get up there.

## Locations
### First Floor
Since the goal was to find [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]], the party did not initially explore the first floor other than the entryway and the area where the stairwell was.

From the little bit the party was able to see on the first floor, the house looked recently lived in and fairly well taken care of.

After the party had defeated the enemy in the basement, they found that the front door had been partially bricked over. The party ended up breaking the door and exiting just in time to get out before the house entirely collapsed.

### Second Floor
The second floor landing leads to a small entryway with 4 suites of armor, each bearing a wolf's head, each holding a spear. The fireplace is at the opposite end from the stairs, and above it is a portrait of a family of 5. The mother seems to be staring daggers at the youngest baby.

#### Rooms

- [[Music Room (Durst Residence)|Music Room]]
- [[Servant's Quarters|Servant's Quarters]]
- [[Windmill Room|Windmill Room]]

### Third Floor
Directly across from the stairs is another suit of armor with a wolf's head. The majority of this floor looks very dusty and unkept, much unlike the first floor, which looked to be much more recently lived in.

One of the other doors leads to a bathroom. A second door leads to a linen closet.

A wall from the second bedroom opens up to a staircase. This staircase leads up and seems to be even more worn than the rest of the house.

#### Rooms
- [[Margaret's Room|Margaret's Room]]
- [[Nursery|Nursery]]
- [[Master Bedroom (Durst Residence)|Master Bedroom]]

#### Encounters
- Upon approach, the [[Suit of Armor|Suit of Armor]] comes alive and attacks the party
- The spirit of [[Margaret|Margaret]] first interacts with the party here, telling them not to wake baby [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]]. She then led the party to the next floor.

### Fourth floor/Attic

In the landing for this floor, cobwebs extend from floor to ceiling. It is pitch black in here, even the windows are dusted over so heavily that they let no light in.

The ghost of [[Margaret|Margaret]] appears to lead the party into a locked room.

A small, spare room has basic furniture in it, but there does not seem to be anything of note in here.

Another, even smaller spare bedroom has roughly the same contents as the previous one

A storage room here contains many sheet covered shapes, seemingly being covered chests, furniture, and perhaps art, suites of armor, or mannequins. [[Margaret|Margaret]]'s body is found in one of the chests here, seemingly murdered and covered in blood. [[Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] found a [[Gold ring|Gold ring]] here.

#### Childrens' Room

The door to this room was locked at first. Inside, there are two beds, a [[Dollhouse|Dollhouse]] that looks suspiciously like the house. On the floor are the skeletal remains of what seems to be the two Durst children.

After entering this room, the spirits of the two children appeared. Rose looks to have used a spell to repair a toy of her brother's.

### Basement
The basement seems to be where the cult's rituals took place as well as the entrance to the family catacombs. 

Chest 1;

11 gold in a "leather" pouch

Chest 2:

Moss agates 3x10g

Chest 3:

Leather eyepatch with a red carnelian gem and a leatherbound folder containing dates in a sort of chart. Each date has a note like villager homeless person, etc and notes about "no sedative given", "ritual failed". The list is 35 sections long that seem to be from 500 years prior over the course of a year. It starts out sparse and then becomes far more rapid with seemingly more terrible things done to the subjects. The last ritual had a date but does not seem to have any notes, but the one before was noted as "homeless man 100% bloodlet, eviscerated, no results"

Chest 4:

Ivory hairbrush with silver bristles

Chest 5:

A silvered short sword

#### Lower basement

Rhythmic chanting "He is ancient. He is the land" is heard fairly clearly

In the reliquary: severed raven talons, cracked crystal ball, pristine white (angel?) feather, a large dragon scale seemingly made of crystal, a piece of amber, a set of fangs

###### Ritual chamber
This room is very tall and has a lower level with standing water. There is a large dais at the center, and there is a red stain seemingly covering everything.

There is a table with "implements" off to the side
