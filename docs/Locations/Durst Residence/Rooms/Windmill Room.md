# Windmill Room

One set of double doors on the second floor of the [[Durst Residence|Durst Residence]] leads to a room with a lot of fancy looking furniture. There is a painting of some kind of windmill. In one of the bookcases here, [[Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] found a book entitled "[[The Life and Death of Faeryl Hune|The Life and Death of Faeryl Hune]]".

The party found sheet music entitled "[[Song for Elisabeth|Song for Elisabeth]]" on which was written a clue: "Bull Wharton's words can open the way". [[Faeryl Hune|Faeryl Hune]] found a book written by a Bull Wharton, and moving that book opened a passage to a small secret area.

## Secret Area

A body is found in this secret area, leaning over a chest. The clothes on this body look to have been clothes for an adventuring scout, and the body has a dart sticking out of it. The chest appeared to have been trapped, but with the only dart already used, searching the chest was not dangerous.

Books in here contain rituals for summoning fiends. The rituals seem to come from a cult called [[Priests of Osybus|Priests of Osybus]]. [[Thorn|Thorn]] found the [[Deed to the Windmill|Deed to the Windmill]]; a [[Signed Will|Signed Will]], leaving everything to [[Rosalda Durst|Rosalda Durst]] and [[Thornbolt Durst|Thornbolt Durst]]; the [[1st Letter from Strahd|1st Letter from Strahd]]; and a key.
