# Music Room
This room, found on the second floor of the [[../Durst Residence|Durst Residence]] seemed to be in pristine condition when the party first entered. Inside, they found a well-kept harpsicord and a harp. Stained glass decorated the walls.

After entering this room, the party discussed the [[../../../Items/Durst Residence/Song for Elisabeth|Song for Elisabeth]], and [[../../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] played this song on the harp. During the song, the room seemed to come alive with apparitions dancing along with the music, but across the room, [[../../../Characters/Durst Residence/Gustav Durst|Gustav Durst]] and [[../../../Characters/Durst Residence/Elisabeth Durst|Elisabeth Durst]] stared angrily at the party.

Once [[../../../Party/Thistle|Thistle]] had finished playing, the lights in this room went out, and the strings of the harp were cut. Once they were able to see again, the party realized that the room no longer looked well-kept and was in facty dusty and old, like much of the rest of the house
