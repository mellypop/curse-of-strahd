# Nursery
This is the room in which the party first encounters what looks like a baby swaddled in white cloth. When they approach the crib in which that bundle is a spectral hand reaches out to stop them. This hand belongs to the spirit of [[Margaret|Margaret]] who warns them not to wake baby [[Walter Durst|Walter Durst]].
